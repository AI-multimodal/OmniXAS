- Comparisions with MPNN:

  - Do random split for FC and LR
  - Do decile split

- Setting the linearity debate:

  - What metrics to consider
  - Is there metric to judge complexity of the problem even before tying the
    model implementation?

- Using the simplicity to advantage:

  - Interpretablity:
    - Which feature among 64 is siginficant
    - How does it map to the spectral property
    - Maybe other interpretable model than linear
  - What is amount of data needed ?
  - What other simplity advantage is there?

- Calculating the importance of M3gnet:
  - Do prediction using describ model without GNN and compare:
    - Important one is LMBTR
