## Urgent

- [ ] Rescale the VASP data on theoretical basis:
    - [ ] make the ids, mu and such matchup in wrangling code
- [ ] m3gnet retrain prelims

## Misc

- [ ] Do decile split

- [x] Comparisions with MPNN:

  - [x] Do random split for FC and LR

## Git

## Overreach

- [ ] the simplicity to advantage:

  - [ ] Any other metrics to judge linearity or complexity of problem in general
  - [ ] Interpretablity:
    - [ ] Which feature among 64 is siginficant
    - [ ] How does it map to the spectral property
    - [ ] Maybe other interpretable model than linear
  - [ ] What is amount of data needed ?
  - [ ] What other simplity advantage is there?

- [ ] Calculating the importance of M3gnet:
  - [ ] Do prediction using describ model without GNN and compare:
    - [ ] Important one is LMBTR
